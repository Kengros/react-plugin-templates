Plug-able React templates using [suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense) and [react-universal-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component) for asnyc rendering dynamically imported components. (Proof of Concept)

### Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and run npm install to setup the dependencies. Then run npm start to launch the application.
